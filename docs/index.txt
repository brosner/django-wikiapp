Django-wikiapp provides the very miminum of functinalities one might expect from a modern Wiki, like simple markup syntax and revision control, leaving other website expecific features, like sitemaps, to the developers integrating Wikiapp into their projects. Some Wikiapp features, like feeds for article changes and article classification by tagging, depends on other django reusable applications. Wikiapp articles can be "pluggled" to any model that you want to serve as a "group" of articles.
